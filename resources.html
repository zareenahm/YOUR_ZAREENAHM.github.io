  <h4 class="resource">Getting Girls Back to School in Afghanistan </a>- This UNICEF article briefly explains the education situation for Afghan girls and they describe what they're doing to help. Although it is brief, the article gives a nice, concise, summary with hyperlinks if you would like to further investigate. </h4>

    <h4 class="resource">Learning Crisis and Girls' Education in Afghanistan </a> - Professor of Development Economics at the University of Malaya, M Niaz Asadullah, reflects on the slow progression towards improvement in Afghan girls' education. He connects this to reign of the Taliban and interesingly enough, explains the impact COVID-19 has had on girls' education.</h4>

    <h4 class="resource">Afghanistan: Girls Struggle For An Education</a> - The majority of my research came from this Human Rights Watch article. It is the perfect medium between brief and extensive. Not only does the article explain the issue, but it also explains what the Afghan government must do to make progress. The author included quotes from school-age girls and other community members that really put the issue into perspective.</h4>

    <h4 class="resource">“I Won’t Be a Doctor, and One Day You’ll Be Sick” </a> - This article is also from Human Rights Watch, but it is much more thorough, with detailed descriptions of schooling circumstances and a plethora of statistics. It also brings in the government, legal obligations, donors, and more as additional factors.</h4>
