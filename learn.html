  <h1 id="learnTheProblem">What's The Problem?</h1>
  <p class="learnMoreWords">There are various factors that contribute to the state of education in Afghanistan, a few being: inadequate government funding, decades of war, widespread poverty, and violence. UNESCO’s international standards expect countries to spend about 15-20% of their national budget on education, yet, in 2016, education only accounted for 13% of the country's expenditures. This lack of funding means underpaid teachers, lack of infrastructure, no school supplies, and little or no security measures in schools. Because education is not a priority and there are few schools in Afghanistan, children often have to travel far just to get to school. 15 year old Najiba explained that neither she nor her 8 siblings had an education because, “by the time we walked to school, the school day would end.” This inadequate funding is also a product of the decades of war and turmoil the country has faced. The government is more focused on rebuilding and healing. Further, with a majorly agricultural based economy and the state of the country, poverty is inevitable. At a minimum, 25% of children work to help their families scrape by; even if the system improves, their financial state hinders their education altogether. Finally, insecurity surrounding education is a huge problem. There have been multiple cases where the Taliban have targeted schools through: shootings, bombings, acid attacks, etc. and these instances prompt parents to pull their children out of school.</p>

  <h1 id="learnItMeans">What Does This Mean For Girls?</h1>
  <p class="learnMoreWords">In addition to the already existing problems with Afghanistan’s education system, there are deep-seated cultural ideals that come into play when discussing Afghan girls’ access to education. Essentially, the disparities in education is a women's rights issue, something that Afghanistan is definitely familiar with after the Taliban's "War on Women". During their reign, the terrorist group banned all education for girls, and in many families, these principles have persisted, having been falsely justified by religion. Due to cultural values, parents prefer that their daughters are taught alongside other girls and with female teachers. But, with a notable lack of female teachers and weak infrastructure, this is not mostly impossible. Not only that, but with more than half of schools lacking any sort of bathroom facility, girls are forced to stay home for a week every month due to menstruation, which severely hinders their education and leads to many dropping out altogether. In addition to schools being affected by the general state of violence in Afghanistan, the Taliban have made it so that going to school as a girl is a huge safety threat. Sexual harassment, kidnappings, acid attacks, and more are just a few threats to education that girls face on their daily journeys to school. It is important to note that the preceding information only applies to girls whose parents even allow them to attend school. With these extreme security concerns, the prevalence of teen marriage, and the stigma surrounding girls attending school, it is no wonder there is such a disparity within the education system. </p>
